[size=5][b]Description[/b][/size]

Tired of losing track of time while exploring the dangerous lands of Valheim? **Valheim Clock** adds a clean, unobtrusive analog clock to your HUD that displays the current in-game time. Whether you're planning your adventures around the day/night cycle or just want to know when to head back home before dark, this mod has you covered.

The clock seamlessly integrates into the game's UI, appearing only when you're actually playing - no clutter in menus or during loading screens.
